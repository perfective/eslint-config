== Overview

The purpose of this configuration is to create a subset of the JavaScript and TypeScript languages,
to enforce code quality, readability, and maintainability.
It is based on the ideas that:

* Code maintainability and support cost more than original development.
* Code readability is more important than the speed of writing it.

It brings the https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18197267-don-t-make-me-think-revisited[Don't Make Me Think]
approach from web usability to code,
and assumes that:

* Simple code is better than complex code.
* Certainty is better than uncertainty.
* Explicit statements are better than implicit statements.
